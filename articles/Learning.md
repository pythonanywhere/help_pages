## Courses and other learning materials

Here is a selection of courses and other learning materials that we either know
are good or that our users have told us are worth doing.


### kikodo

[kikodo](https://www.kikodo.io/) provide a range of free and paid courses in the basics of Python.


### Django for Everybody by Chuck Severance

Chuck's courses are great and we highly recommend them!  [Django for everybody](https://www.dj4e.com)
is a great option for learning, well, Django :-) It's also available [on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-build-web-apps).


### Django Girls

Django Girls is an organisation devoted to running
workshops introducing women to programming, and if you are interested in doing one of them,
check out [their website](https://djangogirls.org/en/).

Even if you're not able to go to one of their workshops, their online
[Django tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) is an excellent introduction
to Django for anyone of any gender.
