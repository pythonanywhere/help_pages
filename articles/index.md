Many of your questions about PythonAnywhere are likely to be answered below. If
not, the best place to get support is in
our [**Forums**](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/forums/). We monitor them to make
sure that every question gets answered, and you get the added benefit that
other PythonAnywhere customers can help you out too. They're also a nice place
for a chat ![:-\)](/smile.png)

If you want, you can access an even broader group of people by asking your
questions on *StackOverflow*; we check
[all posts there tagged with pythonanywhere](//stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pythonanywhere)
 daily, and reply if no-one else has already solved the problem.

But if you want to ask your questions in private and get responses over **email**,
you can use the "Send feedback" link at the top of any page on PythonAnywhere.
We'll be alerted and will get back to you ASAP.  You can also email us directly
via [support@pythonanywhere.com](mailto:support@pythonanywhere.com)

If you want help about Python programming generally (as opposed to
PythonAnywhere), you can
[buy 1:1 live Python help at Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/python-experts?utm_source=pythonanywhere&utm_medium=text-link&utm_content=forums&utm_campaign=pa-q1).


The help pages have the following sections -- hopefully you can jump straight to one that describes what you're looking for help with!

# I've got an existing web app that I'm trying to deploy

  * [I can't see what I'm typing in the console](/pages/ICantSeeWhatIAmTyping)



# I'm looking at an error message in my web app


Oh no!  But fear not -- the likelihood is that we've seen someone else with this error before, and we know how to fix it.

If you haven't already, the first step is to look in your **error log** -- you'll find a link to it on the [Web tab](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/web_app_setup/).

Once you've done that, here are some solutions to common problems

  * [Debugging import errors and sys.path issues](/pages/DebuggingImportError)  <--  if you've just started setting up your app, chances are the answer is in here.
  * [I'm getting a 502 Bad Gateway error. How can I debug?](/pages/502BadGateway)
  * [I'm getting a 400 Bad Request error from my Django app](/pages/Django400BadRequest)
  * [Fixing "OperationalError: 2006 MySQL server has gone away"](/pages/ManagingDatabaseConnections)
  * [Fixing "OperationalError: 1226 User has exceeded the max_user_connections resource](/pages/ManagingDatabaseConnections)
  * [I'm seeing lots of GeneratorExit errors in my error log](/pages/GeneratorExit)



# I'm trying to figure out how to get a particular tool or feature to work

Here are some guides for some of the common things people want to do:

  * [Installing new Python modules for yourself](/pages/InstallingNewModules)
  * [How do I keep a console running forever? Or, how do I make a program that restarts automatically? Or, how to I run an async task queue like celery?](/pages/LongRunningTasks)
  * [Can I use matplotlib to generate graphs from my data?](/pages/MatplotLibGraphs)

  * [How to force HTTPS on your web app](/pages/ForcingHTTPS)

  * [Using Selenium](/pages/selenium)
  * [Does PythonAnywhere have an API?](/pages/API)


And here's some very brief FAQ answers about common requests:

  * **Can I use MongoDB**? Only via an external service like mongolabs
  * **Can I use an external MySQL service?** Probably not (on a free account), unless they have an HTTP api.
  * Can I use Redis?  Again, only via an external service like redislabs.  Although you can use redislite
  * Can I use websockets, or run my own socket server?  I'm afraid not --  we only support Python apps that implement the WSGI protocol
  * How do I reload my webapp automatically?  You can now use our [API](/pages/API) for this :)
