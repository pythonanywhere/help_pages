The "Your own domain" option on our "Add a new web app" dialog is normally used
to specify a domain that you own -- something like `www.yourdomain.com`.

However, if you don't own a domain, or don't want to use a fully custom one,
you can also use a custom subdomain of `pythonanywhere.com`.  It must be of the
format

    something-yourusername.pythonanywhere.com

...or, on our EU system:

    something-yourusername.eu.pythonanywhere.com

...where the "something" can be any combination of numbers and letters, and the
"yourusername" is your normal PythonAnywhere username.
