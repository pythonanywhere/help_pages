An internal server error on a website that you're hosting on PythonAnywhere is
an indication that something is going wrong in your code.  To find out exactly
what that is, you need to take a look at your website's error log.  There's a
link to the error log on the "Web" page inside PythonAnywhere, and the most
recent error message will be at the bottom of the file.

Hopefully once you've seen the message there, you'll be able to debug
the problem.  If you get completely stuck, then you can contact
PythonAnywhere support by using the "Send feedback" link on your
account page -- we can help on PythonAnywhere-specific issues, and
while we can't in general give programming coaching or tuition, we may
be able to point you in the right direction to get help.
