##The theory


When you say:

    :::python
    from foo.bar import baz



Python will start by looking for a *module* named foo, and then inside that a module named bar, and then inside that for an object named baz (which may be a regular python object, or another module)

A **module** is defined as:

  * either a Python file
    * ie a file on disk that ends in .py and contains valid Python (syntax errors, for example, will stop you from being able to import a file)

  * or a folder which contains Python files.
    * for a folder to become a module, it must contain a special file called `__init__.py`

When a module is actually a folder, the things you can import from it are:

  * any other modules that are inside the folder (ie, more .py files and folders)
  * any objects defined or imported inside the `__init__.py` of the folder

Finally, where does Python look for modules? It looks in each directory specified in the special "sys.path" variable. Typically (but not always), sys.path contains some default folders, including the current working directory, and the standard "packages" directory for that system, usually called site-packages, which is where pip installs stuff to.

So `from foo.bar import baz` could work in a few different ways:

    .
    `-- foo/
        |-- __init__.py
        `-- bar.py          <-- contains a variable called "baz"


Or

    .
    `-- foo/
        |-- __init__.py
        `-- bar/
            |-- __init__.py
            `-- baz.py


Or:

    .
    `-- foo/
        |-- __init__.py
        `-- bar/
            `-- __init__.py     <-- contains a variable called "baz"


What this means is that you need to get a few things right for an import to work:

1. The dot-notation has to work: from foo.bar import baz means foo has to be a module folder, and bar can either be a folder or a file, as long as it somehow contains a thing called baz. Spelling mistakes, including capitalization, matter
2. The top-level "foo" must be inside a folder that's on your sys.path.
3. If you have multiple modules called "foo" on your sys.path, that will probably lead to confusion. Python will just pick the first one.


##Debugging sys.path issues in web apps



###can you run the wsgi file itself?


    $ python3.4 -i /var/www/www_my_domain_com_wsgi.py


Or, if you're using python 2:

    $ python2.7 -i /var/www/www_my_domain_com_wsgi.py


Or, if you're using a virtualenv, activate it first:

    $ workon my-virtualenv
    (my-virtualenv)$ python -i /var/www/www_my_domain_com_wsgi.py


If this shows any errors and won't even load python (eg syntax errors), you'll need to fix them.

If it loads OK, it will drop you into a Python shell. Try doing the import manually at the command line. Then, check whether they really are coming from where you think they are:

    :::python
    from foo.bar import baz
    import foo
    print(foo)  # this should show the path to the module.  Is it what you expect?
    import sys
    print('\n'.join(sys.path)) # does this show the files and folders you need?




##Django-specific issues


In Django, we sometimes don't import modules directly in the WSGI file, but we do specify a dot-notation import path to the settings in an environment variable. Django will try and import it later, so you need to get this right as if it was an import.

eg:

    :::python
    path = "/home/myusername/myproject"
    if path not in sys.path
        sys.path.append(path)

    os.environ("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE") = "myproject.settings"



What this implies is that you have a directory tree that looks like this:

    /home/myusername
    `-- myproject/
        |-- __init__.py
        `-- myproject/
            |-- __init__.py
            `-- settings.py


NB - this is the typical django project structure for django versions greater than 1.4. You will probably need to use a virtualenv to get this to work, see [VirtualenvForNewerDjango](/pages/VirtualEnvForNewerDjango)

If in doubt, try the

    python -i /var/www/www_my_domain_com_wsgi.py
    >>> import myproject.settings
    # this should work. if this doesn't, figure out why.  print sys.path, etc.



###Other tips



####Can you run the files it's trying to import?


eg, if your wsgi file does `from myapp import settings`, can you run:

    python /path/to/myapp/settings.py


?


####Shadowing


Could there be any sort of "shadowing" going on? do any of your modules have the same name as system modules? eg, if you're trying to do

    :::python
    from package import thing


What happens if you open up a console and type

    :::python
    import package
    print(package)


does it give you the path to your package, or to a system package? if the latter, it's best to rename your own module to avoid the conflict.


##Check virtualenv Python versions


If you're using a virtualenv, just double-check that the Python version of your virtualenv is the same as the one on the web tab.

  * you can check the virtualenv version with `python --version` (remember to activate your virtualenv fist with `workon my-virtualenv-name` first)
  * you can check the webapp python version on the **Web** tab, it's indicated near the top.
