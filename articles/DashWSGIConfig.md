Dash apps have a app.server that you need to pass to WSGI. Your WSGI file (which
you can find linked from the "Web" page) will have something like this:

    :::python
    from myapp import app
    application = app.server

We followed [this Dash tutorial](https://plot.ly/dash/getting-started)
and created [this website](http://dashingdemo.pythonanywhere.com/) using the
code from the first example. You can take a look at the git repo [here](https://github.com/pythonanywhere/dashingdemo).

Other than that, be sure to check out our guide to [Debugging import errors](/pages/DebuggingImportError) for general tips on dealing with problems in your wsgi config.
