Your Postgres data on PythonAnywhere is fully protected against hardware
failure. However, we do not automatically support rolling back to a point in
time. If you want protection from accidental changes, you can set up a [scheduled 
task](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/ScheduledTasks/) to regularly back 
your data up to a file, which you can re-load into
Postgres at a later date.

Here's an example of a command that can dump a particular database called
"mydb":

    :::bash
    pg_dump --host=HOSTNAME --port=PORT --username=super --format=c --file=pgbackup`date +%F-%H%M`.dump mydb

This command will perform so called _"logical backup"_, not a _"physical
backup"_ or a _"file-system-level backup"_ as PostgreSQL documentation calls it,
which is not supported on PythonAnywhere.

You can find your `HOSTNAME` and `PORT` values on the **Databases tab**. The
`HOSTNAME` will look something like `myusername-667.postgres.pythonanywhere-services.com`.  
See [this page](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/PostgresGettingStarted/)
if you need more information on Postgres setup and configuration.

You'll want to experiment with `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` until you have a
backup command which you have confidence in -- remember, an untested backup
procedure isn't a backup procedure at all!
