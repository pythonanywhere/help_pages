Which versions of Python you have available to you depend on the
system image that your account uses.  The system image is essentially the
version of the operating system that your code runs under, and is set when
you initially create your account, but you can
[change it to a more recent one](/pages/ChangingSystemImage) later on.

Here are the current system images, and the Python versions that each one
supports:

|             |2.7|3.5|3.6|3.7|3.8|3.9|3.10|
|-------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|
| glastonbury | X | X | X | X | X | X |    |
| haggis      | X |   | X | X | X | X | X  |
