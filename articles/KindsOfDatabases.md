##Databases available

There are three databases built in to PythonAnywhere:

* MySQL, which is available for every user
* SQLite, which is also available for everyone, but runs a bit slowly on our system -- we
  recommend you only use it for testing or for scripts that don't do a lot of processing.
* [Postgres](/pages/Postgres) in available in paid plans only, as an add-on.

We're considering adding built-in support for MongoDB and Redis in the future --
if you're interested in it (or something else entirely), let us know!

### Connecting to external databases

If you have a paid plan, you can connect to databases outside PythonAnywhere.
This means that you can get, say, a Redis instance from [Redis Labs](https://redislabs.com/),
a MongoDB instance from [mLab](https://mlab.com/), or a [Microsoft SQL Server](/pages/MSSQLServer)
instance from [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), and connect to it from
your code.  If the provider you choose has the option to place your database
in a specific Amazon Web Services Availability Zone, then putting it in
us-east-1 will put it very close to our servers and give the best performance.
