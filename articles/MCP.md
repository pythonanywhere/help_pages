You can connect your AI coding assistant directly to PythonAnywhere using our
experimental [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server. 

It works with Claude, Copilot, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible tool.

For detailed instructions on how to set it up, see [the GitHub repo of the 
project](https://github.com/pythonanywhere/pythonanywhere-mcp-server#readme).

There is also a blog post about it [here](https://blog.pythonanywhere.com/220/)
