If you can't log into your account because you forgot the password, you can
reset it by using the "Forgotten password?" link on the Log In page.  If you
created multiple accounts associated with the same email address, you will
receive a password reset link for each one of them!  You need to use the link for
the account whose password you want to reset.

If you don't receive the email, check your spam folder first.

If that doesn't work, it may be because you never confirmed your email address.
In that case, please use [this form](https://support.anaconda.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
to contact support.  To submit your request:

- choose `Non-Technical Request` category in the main drop-down menu
- choose `PythonAnywhere` in **Routing**
- use "Password reset request" as subject

We'll see what we can do!

Please note that if you have not used your account
for a long time, it could have been permanently deleted.
