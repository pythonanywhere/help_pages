##Types of PythonAnywhere consoles


In the [Consoles page](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/consoles/) you'll find links to start various types of console: 

  * Python 2.7, 2.6 or 3.3, using either the standard Python shell or IPython. If you've never tried IPython, check it out, it's pretty cool! 
  * Bash 
  * [PyPy](//pypy.org/) (experimental) 
  * MySQL
