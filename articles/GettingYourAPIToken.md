### Getting your API token

log in to PythonAnywhere, and go to the "Account" page using the link at the
top right. Click on the "API token" tab; if you don't already have a token, it
will look like this:

<img alt="API token not set up" src="/api-token-needs-generation.png" class="bordered-image">

Click the "Create a new API token" button to get your token, and you'll see
this:

<img alt="API token set up" src="/api-token-set-up.png" class="bordered-image">

That string of letters and numbers (masked out in the screenshot) is the API
token, and anyone who has it can access your PythonAnywhere account and do
stuff -- so keep it secret. If someone does somehow get hold of it, you can
revoke it on this page by clicking the red button -- that stops it from working
in the future, and creates a new one for you to use.
