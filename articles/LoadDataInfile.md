When trying to get data in mysql, you may see an error a little like this:

    Error Code: 1045 Access denied for user 'myusername'@'%' (using password: YES)

The newer versions of mysql client block load data by default. You need to pass it in as a command line switch. If you open up a Bash console you can connect the the mysql database manually like so:

    :::bash
    mysql -h myusername.mysql.pythonanywhere-services.com -u myusername 'myusername$default' -p --local-infile=1

"--local-infile=1" enables the load data command. You will be prompted for your password.
