  * Open a Bash console and cd to your web2py directory. You'll know you're in the right place if there's a file called `parameters_443.py` in the directory.
  * Run this:

        ::python
        python -c "from gluon.main import save_password; save_password(raw_input('admin password: '),443)"

  * Reload your webapp.
