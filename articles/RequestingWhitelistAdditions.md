## Whitelist explanation

Our whitelist is in place to prevent malicious users from using free accounts
to hack into and generally spam other websites.


## Requesting an addition to the whitelist

We only whitelist sites that have an official, public, documented API -- ie, sites
that are designed and intended for machine consumption rather than human consumption.

If you would like us to whitelist a site, send us an email or feedback request, including:

* a link to the API documentation
* the domain or domains (including subdomains) that the API is served from.
