## Whitelist explanation

Our whitelist is in place to prevent malicious users from using *free* accounts
to hack into and generally spam other websites anonymously.

It does not apply to paid
accounts, as we can link them to real people via the payment details, so they
have unrestricted Internet access.


## Requesting an addition to the whitelist

We only whitelist sites that have an official, public, documented API -- ie, sites
that are designed and intended for machine consumption rather than human consumption.

If you would like us to whitelist a site, send us an email or feedback request, including:

* a link to the API documentation. Particularly to documentation that states
  the domain where the API is published.
* the domain or domains (including subdomains) that the API is served from.
