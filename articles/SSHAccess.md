If you have a paid-for PythonAnywhere account, you can access it via SSH.
The SSH server for your account depends on which one of our sites you signed up
to:

* If you're using our global, US-hosted site at `www.pythonanywhere.com`, then the
  SSH server's hostname is `ssh.pythonanywhere.com`
* If you're using our EU-hosted site at `eu.pythonanywhere.com`, then the
  SSH server's hostname is `ssh.eu.pythonanywhere.com`

Here's how to use that:

From a command line with the `ssh` command installed

    ssh <username>@<ssh server hostname>

The server's fingerprint is:

    MD5:d5:50:bd:8e:23:eb:14:3f:cf:15:87:42:0b:bf:e2:60
    SHA256:zy2jmqxNg/fs6tFZK55OjHTI3B2UofzOiUvTPtcX3/Y

NB: &lt;username&gt; is your PythonAnywhere username -- not your email address.
It's also case-sensitive, so if your username is "MyUsername", then you have to
use that -- "myusername" won't work.

The password is the same password you use to login to the web site.

You can also use public/private keys in order to enable passwordless logins via SSH.
Just add your public keys to the file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` -- it's a plain-text
file with one key per line.


### Debugging

Sometimes, for some reason, you may not be able to login using SSH. The
starting point to working out what is going wrong is to run:

    ssh -v <username>@<ssh server hostname>


### Filezilla, etc

You can also use SSH access to get files into your account using Filezilla and
other similar upload tools. [Details here](/pages/UploadingAndDownloadingFiles).
