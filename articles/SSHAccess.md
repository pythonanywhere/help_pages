If you have a paid-for PythonAnywhere account, you can access it via ssh.
Here's how: 

From a command line with ssh installed 

    ssh <username>@ssh.pythonanywhere.com


The server's fingerprint is: 

    d5:50:bd:8e:23:eb:14:3f:cf:15:87:42:0b:bf:e2:60


NB: &lt;username&gt; is your PythonAnywhere username. Not your email address.
The password is the same password you use to login to the web site. 

You can use public / private keys to login via ssh. Please add your public keys
to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` in order to enable passwordless logins. 


### Debugging

Sometimes, for some reason, you may not be able to login using SSH. The
starting point to working out what is going wrong is to run:

    ssh -v <username>@ssh.pythonanywhere.com
    

###Filezilla etc


You can also use SSH access to get files into your account using Filezilla and
other similar upload tools. [Details here](/pages/FTP)
